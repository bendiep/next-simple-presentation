# next-simple-presentation

A simple web app for quickly creating a decent-looking backdrop before a presentation.

It's designed to be run `locally` and used when `sharing screen` during a video call.

You can easily configure the presenter's `photos`, `name`, and presentation `topic`. The app also features a `countdown timer` to let your audience know how much longer until the start time. Additionally, features both `light` and `dark mode` options.
